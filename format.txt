The file format consists of a sequence of blocks. Each block starts with
1 type byte, and 3 bytes denoting the size of the data following. Blocks
are, consequently, at most 16 MB bytes in size, and padded at the end to
a 4-byte boundary.

All integers are stored in big endian (network) byte order.


Compressed data block format    (block type 1)
----------------------------
4 bytes         dsize   Size of decompressed data (in bytes)
4 bytes         adler   Adler-32 checksum of data block

Terminator  (block type 0)
----------
no data.


Compressed data is compressed in three steps:
    Burrows-Wheeler transom on data block of length L
    MTF transform on data block of length L
    Prepend 4 byte sentinel position, Z
    Enthropy code using Huffman code

The data format for the Huffman coded data is as follows:
    129 bytes   htable  Hufmann code lengths
    dsize - 129 hdata   Huffman coded data
    (TODO: Describe sentinel, and 4-bit layout)

The result of this data is dsize + 4 bytes;




A. Borrow-Wheeler transform
B. Move-to-front encoding
    
C. Huffman-encoding
    129 bytes       htable  Huffman code lengths (4 bits per character)
    size - 129      cdata   Compressed data block
